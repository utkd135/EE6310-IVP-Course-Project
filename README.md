#### Idea behind this project was to use different state of the art modules which the researchers have tried and come up with the combination of these modules that can provide good image creconstruction ability. Papers we looked at includes CoatNet, Wave-Gan, VQ-GAN, VQ-VAE. Our main idea was to cluster the code blocks learned by the model and try to play around with these vectors.
